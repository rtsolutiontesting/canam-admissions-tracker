# 🌐 Domain Decision Guide: Custom Domain vs .web.app

## 🎯 Quick Answer

**For 100% reliability and future-proofing: BUY A CUSTOM DOMAIN**

But let's break down both options:

---

## Option 1: Custom Domain (RECOMMENDED ✅)

### ✅ Advantages

1. **Higher Trust & Credibility**
   - Professional appearance (e.g., `canam-iapply.com`)
   - Better brand recognition
   - Looks more legitimate to users and automated systems

2. **Less Likely to Be Flagged**
   - Custom domains have better reputation
   - Not associated with free hosting patterns
   - Easier to verify ownership

3. **Future-Proof**
   - You own the domain
   - Can switch hosting providers without changing URLs
   - Professional email addresses (e.g., `admin@canam-iapply.com`)

4. **Better SEO & Branding**
   - Easier to remember
   - Professional email addresses
   - Can use subdomains (e.g., `app.canam-iapply.com`)

5. **No "Dangerous Site" Issues**
   - Custom domains rarely get flagged
   - Better reputation with Google Safe Browsing
   - Easier to appeal if needed

### ❌ Disadvantages

1. **Cost**
   - Domain: $10-15/year (e.g., Namecheap, Google Domains)

## 💡 Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

You can use BOTH:

1. **Custom domain** for production: `canam-iapply.com`
2. **.web.app** for testing: `your-app.web.app`

**Benefits:**
- Professional domain for users
- Free domain for testing
- Can switch between them

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

**Suggested:**
- **Domain:** `canam-iapply.com` ($12/year)

- **Result:** Professional, trusted, future-proof

### If Budget is Tight: **Try .web.app First**
