## 📋 **Step 1: Check if GitHub Repo Exists**

First, let's check if the repository exists on GitHub.

**If it doesn't exist yet:**
- We can create it using GitHub CLI (if installed)
- Or you create it at: https://github.com/new

---

## 📋 **Step 2: Push to GitHub**

Once the repo exists, we'll push your code:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/rtsolutiontesting/canam-admissions-tracker.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**If authentication is needed:**
- We'll use GitHub CLI or Personal Access Token
