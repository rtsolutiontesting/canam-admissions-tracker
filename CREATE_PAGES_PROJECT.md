# ✅ Create Cloudflare Pages Project

## 🎯 **You're in the Right Place!**

You're now in **Cloudflare Pages** (I can see `?type=pages` in the URL).

The page says "No projects found" - that's normal! We need to create one.

## 📋 **Step 1: Create Project**

**Look for the blue button:**
- **"Create application"** (top right, blue button)

**Click it!**

## 📋 **Step 2: Select Pages**

After clicking "Create application", you should see options:

1. **Select:** "Pages" (not Workers)
2. **Click:** "Connect to Git" or "Create Pages project"

## 📋 **Step 3: Connect to GitHub**

1. **Click:** "Connect to Git"
2. **Authorize** Cloudflare to access GitHub
3. **Select repository:** `canam-admissions-tracker`
4. **Click:** "Begin setup"

**Set these settings:**

- **Framework preset:** **None** (or "Static")
- **Build command:** (leave completely empty)
- **Build output directory:** **`public`** ⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT!
